# RichardsDiffusion1D-PINNs

This repository provides a **minimal, functional implementation** of a
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for solving the **1D diffusion form of
the Richards equation** using the *Hall mortar* experiment as a reference case.

The goal of this repository is to offer a clean and reproducible starting point
for PINN-based simulations of unsaturated flow in porous media, with an emphasis
on clarity, modularity, and scientific usefulness. Additional experiments and
models will be added over time.
